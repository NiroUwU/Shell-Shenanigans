|               Blackjack Script v1.0 by niro                |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  This is a small blackjack script written in bash shell.   |
|       Please make sure to launch the script via the        |
|         "blackjack.sh" script in the main folder!          |
|     Doing otherwise could cause unexpected behaviour.      |
|                                                            |
|     The code is messy, just dont pay attention to it :p    |
|                                                            |
|   If you encounter any bugs, feel free to contact me via   |
|  GitHub! (this is my longest script to date, so I expect   |
|        some nasty bugs to still hide somewhere)            |
|                                                            |
|                       Thank you :)                         |
