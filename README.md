# Shell-Shenanigans Info
This repository houses my shell scripts i wrote. Not all of them will be useful, but maybe you will find something that interests you :)


# Description of all files
* ## YARSG (Yet Another RPG Style Game)
YARSG is a simple text based rpg game.
It is poorly balanced and isn't too much fun, but it was a fun challenge to write the code :)

* ## Truth-O-Meter
The truth-o-meter script is a script that allows to return a rasndom truthness value of a certain string.

* ## DnD Roll
A small script for automating rolling dice in Dungeons and Dragons - because why not?
It has two modes:
  * #### Roll - roll a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20-sided die
  * #### Freeroll - roll any-sided dice you want, doesn't matter if it's physically possible to even have such a dice irl
