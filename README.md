# Shell-Shenanigans Info
This repository houses my bash shell scripts i wrote. Not all of them will be useful, but maybe you will find something that interests you :)


# Description of all files

* ## Blackjack
The famous gambling game blackjack - what else can i add?
This script - technically "these scripts" - are experimental one, being made out of multiple scripts with one supervisor script.
IMPORTANT: Please only execute the "blackjack.sh" script in the main folder to avoid unexpected results!


* ## DnD Roll
A small script for automating rolling dice in Dungeons and Dragons - because why not?

It has two modes:
  * #### Roll - roll a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20-sided die
  * #### Freeroll - roll any-sided dice you want, doesn't matter if it's physically possible to even have such a dice irl


* ## Jarun
This script compiles a .java file to a .class file and runs it. If you provide a second parameter, the script will delete the .class file after being run.

Syntax:

```
$ jarun [file name (without ".java")] [leave empty if you want your .class file to stay]
```


* ## Truth-O-Meter
The truth-o-meter script is a script that allows to return a random truthness value of a certain string.


* ## YARSG (Yet Another RPG Style Game)
YARSG is a simple text based rpg game.
It is poorly balanced and isn't too much fun, but it was a fun challenge to write the code :)
